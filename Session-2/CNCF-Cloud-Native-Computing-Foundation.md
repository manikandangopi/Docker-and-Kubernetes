## CNCF Principles
| Principle | Meaning (Simple Words) | Example |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------|
| **Containerized** | Put the app and everything it needs inside a single portable package so it runs anywhere | Docker, container images |
| **Microservices** | Break the app into smaller, independent parts so each can be built, updated, and scaled separately | Payment service, User service, Product service |
| **Orchestrated** | Use tools to automatically start, stop, scale, and manage containers | Kubernetes, OpenShift |
| **Declarative APIs** | Tell the system what you want, and it figures out how to do it | Kubernetes YAML files for deployments |
| **Automated & Resilient** | The system can fix itself, recover from failures, and scale automatically | Kubernetes restarts failed pods automatically |
| **DevOps Practices** | Build and deliver software updates quickly and safely using automation | GitHub Actions, ArgoCD |
